# About this blog

This blog is not a monolith, I can tell you that! My ambition is to touch upon at least two areas when developing it:

### Record keeping

Over the last 6 months or so I've been deepening my knowledge and understanding of the climate crisis, its impact, reasons for it, conflicting interest, solutions being developed and applied, etc. and I'd like to keep track of the resources and interesting points of view I come across. At the same time, I'd like to use this site as a platform for developing my own stance on these issues.

### Pragmatic actions and tools

Beyond the conceptual part, I'd also like to be able to contribute practically - most of the time I feel I'm left in the dark about the actual impact that individuals have in their actions and I'd like to translate some of the findings into tangible measures. Also, I'd like to make use of my data science and software development skills and create (hopefully informative) infographics and simple interactive tools. Fingers crossed! 


# About me

I'm a data scientist with a background in evolutionary biology that goes through waves of obsessions that often - albeit not always - end up being reflected in the blog form. Here are some of my previous blogs:

* [Nauka, rzecz ludzka](http://katarzynakulma.blogspot.com/) - "Science, a human thing", popular science blog written in Polish, but with an option to translate it using Google Translate!
* [scienceprone](https://scienceprone.wordpress.com/) - a short-lived blog on science and career in academia.
* [r-tastic](https://r-tastic.co.uk/) - a data science blog with projects built mainly using R language.

Why start yet another blog? Because I genuinely believe that talking about climate change and encouraging every possible action towards remediating it was never more important. I deeply care about wildlife and natural diversity as well as the future that my children will inherit from me (and you!) and this is my way of fighting the sense of powerlessness I get all too often. 



# Acknowledgement

I write this blog using a statistical programming language R (and RStudio as an IDE). This involves working with `blogdown` package authored by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/about/) and the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I deploy the content using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). All these tools are available to everyone for free and are open source, which goes to show in what a wonderful world we live in! My work would not be possible and certainly would not be as productive without the hard work of creators of these tools, so massive thank you all!
